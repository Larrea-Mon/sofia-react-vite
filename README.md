# Sofia React-Vite

This project is an updated version of the original **Sofia React**. Previously, it was bootstrapped with **Create-React-App**. I have now migrated to **Vite** for improved performance and a modern development experience.

I started updating the template to use it in an academic setting and figured that there's no good reason to keep this locked away.

Please check the README-Sofia.md file for more details on the original project.

The original LICENSE from flatlogic still applies. 

This update project is about 80%ish complete but I find it worth publishing now.

Some things that are broken or not adapted:
- Some third party components have been replaced by newer imports but the .CSS is not up to date
- Some components may have unforeseen bugs
- Anything to do with the node.js backend I have not touched
- Anything to do with docker I have not touched
- the sidebar link to #/admin/users doesn't work and I can't be bothered to fix it.

I am not a react or web based developer. 
99% of this update was written by Github Copilot. 

If you want to contribute to the project send me a message I guess.
