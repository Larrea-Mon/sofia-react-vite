Migrating from Create React App (CRA) to Vite
================================================

Migrating a Create React App (CRA) project to Vite is a great way to modernize your setup, improve build speed, and reduce complexity. Here are the main steps youâ€™ll need to take:

9. **Check for Compatibility Issues**
   - Some packages (like `react-scripts`, `@testing-library/react-scripts`, etc.) are CRA-specific and should be removed.
   - Update any absolute imports or aliases (Vite supports `@` for [`src`](src ) by default, or configure your own).

10. **Test and Fix Issues**
    - Run `npm run dev` and fix any issues that arise (import paths, environment variables, etc.).
    - Update any custom Webpack config (e.g., [`config-overrides.js`](config-overrides.js )) to Vite plugins if needed.

---

**Summary:**  
- Install Vite and plugins  
- Move and update `index.html`  
- Update entry point and asset usage  
- Update environment variables  
- Remove CRA-specific code  
- Update scripts  
- Test and fix issues
